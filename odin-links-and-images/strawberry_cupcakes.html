        <li>Beat butter and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract.</li>

    <p>To make strawberry powder: grind 1 to 1.6 oz (depending on your taste) freeze-dried strawberries into a fine powder using a coffee grinder, Magic Bullet® or food processor. You can find freeze-dried strawberries at Trader Joe's® or online, or make your own dried strawberries.

        Dry 1 pound of very thinly sliced fresh strawberries in a 180 degrees F (80 degrees C) oven for 8 hours, then grind as above into a fine powder.
